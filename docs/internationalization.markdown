# Internationalization
BARAM supports international languages though only English and Some Korean translations are available for now.

Language can be set in *Settings/Language* menu.

# How to make translation
Contribution for the translations is welcomed. 

## Updating translation file
In the top directory of BARAM, type following command.

```commandline
(venv) [(...)]$ pyside6-lupdate -extensions py,ui baramFlow baramMesh -ts resources/locale/baram_<lang>.ts
```

*lang* is a two-letter language code from ISO 639-1, and the list of codes can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)


Then run QT Linguist.
```commandline
(venv) [(...)]$ pyside6-linguist resources/locale/baram_<lang>.ts

```

![QT linguist]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/qt_linguist.png)

For each text, follow the sequence.
1. Select a context in *Context* pane
1. Select a string in *Strings" pane
1. Type a translation into *Translation to \<lang\>* in *Source text* pane
1. Finally, make the item as *Done* by clicking the check mark button on the tool bar.

After finishing translation, save the work with *File/Save* menu and *Exit*.


A `.qm` file that is used by BARAM can be generated by following command.

```commandline
(venv) [(...)]$ python convertUi.py
```


Finally, if your language is not in the menu list, you can add it to the file, `view/main_window/menu/settings_language.py`

![Language List in Menu]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/lang_list_menu.png)

![Language List in Code]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/lang_list_code.png)

Once the translation file(.ts) or menu file(settings\_language.py) is completed, the change can be sent to me to merge it into main branch.
Please refer to the [Doc from GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests).
However, if you feel uncomfortable in creating _pull request_, you can just post them on GitHub Issues.
I will check and do the rest of the job.
